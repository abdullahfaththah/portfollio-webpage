                        <p>
                            As part of a collaborative team project, we developed a robust and feature-rich system for a marine services company using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system was designed to streamline business operations and enhance customer satisfaction by efficiently managing various aspects such as orders, suppliers, inventory, employees, and job scheduling.
