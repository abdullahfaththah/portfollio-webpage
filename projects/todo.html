            <h2>Endpoint Log Analysis and Security Incident Investigation</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved performing comprehensive log analysis and conducting security incident investigations to strengthen the security posture of endpoint systems and web applications. By analyzing log records and practicing on Hack The Box Sherlock Labs, I gained hands-on experience in detecting threats, reconstructing incidents, and mitigating potential risks in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log Analysis:</strong> Analyzed web server logs, access logs, and error logs to detect suspicious patterns such as unauthorized access attempts, brute-force attacks, and Local File Inclusion (LFI) exploitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Threat Detection:</strong> Identified and flagged malicious activities, including SQL injection attempts, directory traversal attacks, and privilege escalation attempts.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Investigation:</strong> Reconstructed security incidents by correlating log entries, identifying the origin of attacks, and assessing their impact on endpoints and applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Implemented countermeasures such as IP blocking, rule updates in security tools, and application-level patches to mitigate identified threats.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Tools and Techniques Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Log Analysis Tools: <strong>Splunk</strong>, <strong>ELK Stack</strong>, and <strong>Linux grep commands</strong>.</li>
                <li>Threat Investigation: Practiced using <strong>Hack The Box Sherlock Labs</strong> to simulate real-world scenarios and enhance investigation skills.</li>
                <li>Incident Reconstruction: Correlated logs from web servers, application servers, and network devices to reconstruct attack timelines.</li>
                <li>Security Measures: Strengthened system defenses through log-based alerts, firewall rule updates, and access control policies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Insights from Hack The Box (Sherlock Labs):</h3>
            <p>
                Practicing on Hack The Box Sherlock Labs provided invaluable experience in real-world attack scenarios. These labs simulated incidents such as insider threats, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and privilege abuse. By applying the skills learned, I was able to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect and mitigate privilege escalation attempts through detailed log analysis.</li>
                <li>Identify hidden attack vectors by analyzing patterns in application and network logs.</li>
                <li>Enhance threat-hunting skills using tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and Burp Suite for deeper investigation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project Highlights:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced Log Analysis:</strong> Leveraged tools like Splunk and ELK Stack for visualizing and correlating data, enabling quicker identification of threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Proactive Threat Management:</strong> Designed alert systems to notify about potential security breaches in real time.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Created detailed incident reports that documented attack timelines, root causes, and mitigation strategies for future reference.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This project not only deepened my understanding of endpoint security and web application protection but also enhanced my ability to think critically and solve complex security challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Excited to continue exploring log analysis, threat detection, and advanced incident response strategies in cybersecurity! ðŸš€
